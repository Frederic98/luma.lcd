PDC8544 LCD python bindings for the Raspberry Pi
================================================

Documentation and Python library module for interfacing a PCD8544 LCD 
screen to a Rasbperry Pi. Cheap Nokia 5110 modules can be picked up
on ebay with a breakout board for a few pounds.

Further technical details for the LCD screen can be found in the 
[datasheet](https://raw.github.com/rm-hull/pcd8544/master/doc/tech-spec/datasheet.pdf) [PDF].

Pre-requisites
--------------
Compile and install the wiringPi python bindings from https://github.com/rm-hull/wiringPi. Make sure you install both python-dev and libi2c-dev. 
This library specifically requires the python binding baked into this software, which have
not been pushed back to drogon.

Next, install PIL (Python Imaging Library) as follows:

    $ sudo apt-get install zlibc libpng3 libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev python-pip
    $ sudo pip install pillow

Building and installing the software
------------------------------------
After having cloned from github:

    $ python setup.py clean build
    $ sudo python setup.py install

This should install the files in your local dist-files ares (somewhere
like `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/distfiles/pcd8544`).

Next, test at the hardware and software is working:

    $ cd examples
    $ sudo ./alphabet_text.py

Most of the ASCII character set should be displayed. There are a few
other examples of graphics rendering in the same directory.

Wiring schematic
----------------
There appears to be different pin-out configurations on PCD8544 modules - beware!

Although the python library (currently) used software-base bit-banging to do the SPI chattering, 
the pins chosen should be compatible with hardware SPI. The above diagram was modified for 
*my* wiring setup from an SVG from http://shiro.be/ - all rights of the original author reserved.

Stripboard Layout
-----------------
With 4 push-buttons, resistor values 10K.

Buttons (from top to bottom) are wired onto BCM pins as follows:

* GPIO 14 (TxD)
* GPIO 17 
* GPIO 25
* GPIO 22

TODO
----
* Documentation

* More examples

* Introduce small/tiny font handling onto drawable PIL surfaces

* Implement module for scanning push buttons 

* Hardware SPI rather than software emulation
